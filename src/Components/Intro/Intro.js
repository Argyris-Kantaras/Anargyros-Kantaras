          Growing up, I always had some kind of love towards electronics until I
          learned about programming. I started learning some basics and since
          then, I got passionate and got deep into it. I'm quietly confident,
          naturally curious and perpetually working on improving my skills and
          knowledge, as well as my problem solving ability. I already have some
          great skills but as it is well known in programming we never know
          everything.
